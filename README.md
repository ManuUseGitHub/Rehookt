React has introduced the hooks system to manage states in react applications. It is handy, tho it can be repetitive to use them. Some may want to not include store systems in their application because of the amount of boilerplate code to make everything work.

by understanding the main purpose of hooks, I created a module that can create hooks even on the fly and make them more intuitive to use.
